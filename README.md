# Personal Development Time

**What is this README for?**

This README encompasses everything that I (Toby) have been completing during my PD time.

## Week 1
###### What occured in week 1 ######
The main teachings in week 1 were the SDLC and a small portion on debugging, these topics were realtively understood in the first week - so I focused on finding out more, such as lifecycles that 
are not well known/used.

Static and dynamic testing was also involved during this week, so personal development time was more focued on finding out extra information on this subject.

## Week 2
###### What occured in week 2 ######
In week 2 the travel apps had begun to be developed
and brainstormed - the personal development time within this week was focused on the improvement and 
design idea creation. The timetable for the presentations were also released mid week, which allowed myself to brainstorm about about what topic
I would be doing.

Jacob had delved deeper into the SDLC and STLC as well as naming conventions - this was also look at within the PD time.

## Week 3
###### What occured in week 3 ######
Mid way through week 3 the travel app project was released - this was a group activity that involved the creation of many design mockups on Figma relating to each page the travel app would have. 

The travel app project also involved the documenting of what a team of designers, developers and testers would need for this travel app to be created. This was completed by developing a work document involving a specification. The PD time was mainly focused on these activities throughout the week.

(The presentation also occured during this week - so I had been preparing slides during PD time as well.)


## Week 4
###### What occured in week 4 ######
Week 4 involved a lot of Jest and testing development in JavaScript - the rabbit program was the main testing focus. The jest test cases were the main focuses on the personal development time for this week.

## Week 5
###### What occured in week 5 ######
Week 5 involved a lot of different focuses within personal development time. During the first couple days I focused on Git and the use of cloning and commiting to a respository. 

The next couple days DOM was introduced for web-page manipulation - and a small project followed to create a personal HTML page with added CSS and JavaScript, this was the main focus of the PD time during this week, focusing on the development of the personal HTML page project. 

On the friday the cucumber framework was introduced, this was looked at a bit during Friday's PD time.



## Week 6
###### What occured in week 6 ######
Week 6 involved a deeper look into Cucumber and Selenium, where we have been testing our self-made portfolio websites done in the week prior. The personal development time that was done this week focused on improving my Selenium tests to properly tests certain features on the website, such as buttons changing certain colours for example.
