# Personal Development Time

**What is this README for?**

This README encompasses everything that I (Toby) have been completing during my PD time.

## Week 1
###### What occured in week 1 ######
The main teachings in week 1 were the SDLC and a small portion on debugging, these topics were realtively understood in the first week - so I focused on finding out more, such as lifecycles that 
are not well known/used.

Static and dynamic testing was also involved during this week, so personal development time was more focued on finding out extra information on this subject.

## Week 2
###### What occured in week 2 ######
In week 2 the travel apps had begun to be developed
and brainstormed - the personal development time within this week was focused on the improvement and 
design idea creation. The timetable for the presentations were also released mid week, which allowed myself to brainstorm about about what topic
I would be doing.

Jacob had delved deeper into the SDLC and STLC as well as naming conventions - this was also look at within the PD time.

## Week 3
###### What occured in week 3 ######
Mid way through week 3 the travel app project was released - this was a group activity that involved the creation of many design mockups on Figma relating to each page the travel app would have. 

The travel app project also involved the documenting of what a team of designers, developers and testers would need for this travel app to be created. This was completed by developing a work document involving a specification. The PD time was mainly focused on these activities throughout the week.

(The presentation also occured during this week - so I had been preparing slides during PD time as well.)
